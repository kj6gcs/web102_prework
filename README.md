# WEB102 Prework - _Sea Monster Crowdfunding_

Submitted by: **Robby Wideman**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [✓] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
- [✓] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
- [✓] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
- [✓] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [✓] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
  - [✓] Added a search feature between game stats and "Our Games" section. Search feature is a live model, sorting through the list of games as the user types out their search.
  - [✓] Implemented some basic aesthetic properties to the search bar.
  - [✓] Created a quick navigation button in the header which takes the page down to the "Our Games" section. The "Our Games" section was made a target in index.html.
  - [✓] Coded each stat card/button/game description card with box-glow, smooth transition, & y axis movement to make it feel like the items are popping out when hovered over by the user.

## Notes

I'd say the biggest challenge for me on this was going back to CSS3, which I haven't used in a while. I've been using Tailwind CSS for so long I had to revisit some base concepts.
